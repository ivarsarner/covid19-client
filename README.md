This is an app built in React which connects to a backend API endpoint to get data of current Covid-19 cases in USA.

In production it connects to the backend where it's deployed on Heroku, however for local development, make sure to add 
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:9000/covid
to the environment.
